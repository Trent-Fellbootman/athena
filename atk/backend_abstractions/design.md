# Backend Design

This package contains abstractions for multiple AI backends.

The first one to support is a chat backend, as a chat-style backend
such as ChatGPT allows for high-level planning and thus the possibility
of large-scale autonomous AI systems involving multiple intelligent
agents doing planning and cooperation.

Future supporting plans may include image generation, video generation,
code generation, etc.
