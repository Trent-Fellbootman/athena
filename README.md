# AAIS (Automated AI Systems) Toolkit

AAIS toolkit is a framework for developing scalable,
capable and coherent systems powered by AI.
It supports multi-modality, external API integration,
parallelism among multiple AI workers, error correction, and more.
It is designed to be the PyTorch, Tensorflow and JAX for the
new field of AI that emerged at the end of 2022, with the advent
of ChatGPT: automated prompting.

Possible use cases of this framework include:

- AI-native applications and OS;
- AI-based applications (e.g., AI-based game engines)
- AI assistant for consumer applications that integrates
AI into the application's functionalities (e.g., Siri).
